    ---- Learn Python ----

python is a very popular programming language as of late 2024.

python can be used on a server, to create web applications.

{
print("Hello, World!")
}

        What is python &&|| used for ?

        - web development (server-side).
        - software development,
        - mathematics,
        - system scripting.

        What Can Python Do ?

        - Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
        - Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
        - Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
        - Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
        - Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

        Why Python ?

        - Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
        - Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
        - Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
        - Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
        - Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

        What Is Good To Know About Python?

        - The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
        
        - In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
    
        Python Syntax : Compared To Other Programming Languages

        - Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.

        - Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.

        - Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.




        ---- Python Install(ation) 
                ----
        
        - to check on linux or windows | python --version

        - to run or use python, type the command | python file_name.py

        -- Version of Python Editor -- Checked By Importing System Module --

        - run the command | import sys | print(sys.version)

        # | is seperating commands, not used in python, new line instead

        - when you are done in python command line, type the simple command: exit()


        ---- Python Syntax Understanding and Executin ----

        -- Python indentation

         - indentation refers to spaces at the beggining of a code line.

         - as in most other programing languages, indentation in code is for readability only. In Python3, indentation matters in the code.

         - the syntax uses indendation to indicate a block of code.

         - Example: 
         if 5 > 2:
           print("Five is greater than two!")

        Note: The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

        
        In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

        x = 5
        y = "Hello, World!"

        also, '' and "" are equivalent in python and both work.

        comments are 1 line and assumed by the symbol #

        you can create ignored string text as multiline comments
        if you use:

        """

        text in the quoatations

        """


        -- Creating Variables --

        x = 5  # declaring x as 5 and is a type int
        y = "aName" # declaring y as aName and is a type str
        print(x) printing # (variable x declaration)
        print(y) printing # (variable y declaration)

        - Casting -

        x = str(3) # x will be '3'
        y = int(3) # y will be 3
        z = float(3) # z will be 3.0

        - Get the Type -

        data type with a variable function: type()

        x = 5
        y = "aName"
        print(type(x))
        print(type(y))

        - Single vs Double Quotes'

        x = "aName"
        # is the same as
        x = 'aName'

        - Case Sensitivity -

        a = 4
        A = "bname"
        # A will not overwrite a 

        -- Python Variable Names : Ruleset --

        A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables: 

              A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
              
              A variable name cannot start with a number
              
              A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
              
              Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
              
              A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
