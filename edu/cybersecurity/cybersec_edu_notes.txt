--- Cyber Security Cyber Crime ---



Some Common Crimes : Identity Theft, Online Predators, Ransomware, Stealing Data, etc.

- Identity theft can have significant consequences on an individual, causing potential financial losses & even excessive personal grief.

Challenges should be considered when approaching security terms ; as it can be difficult to track for many reasons. Remote Servers / PC Control can be manipulated from attackers. The system traced could be a system that is virtual and relocated, meaning if your data or identiy is targeted, catching the victim
is extremely difficult under most circumstances. Stay safe, vigilant. 



--- Cyber Security Money Making Threats ---



Ransomware / Malware injections to encrypt the files or system locking users out.

DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) | using bandwith and some form of software or command line set to execute the speed and efficiency of internet and system to the system as an attempt to basically beat it down 'think falling down on tug of war' [one side is exerting more force over the other]

essential to have a solid understanding of how computers
communicate. There is often much more behind the scenes 'logs, terminal, non-GUI'.

The OSI("Open Systems Interconnection") represents an easy and intuitive way to standarize the different parts required to communicate across networks.

        -- OSI Model --

    IP - 'The' Internet Protocol
    
     ~ IP is used to communicate across networks, not only across physical links, but also networks of/within routers. The addressing scheme in use is either IPv4 or IPv6
     
     ~ IP networks can be broken into different sections, oftn called subnets. This is accomplished by adding an extra piece of information, together with the IP address, called a 'NETMASK'. The netmask dictates how large a network is and which packet is routed within the network and which should be routed outside of the network.
     
     ~ Netmasks can be represented via decimal numbers or with a slash notation. When using slash notaion, the slash follows the system IP address. Here are some examples:
     
     
     IP Address 		Slash Notation 			Netmask
     
     10.0.0.1	 |  /8 - Ex: 10.0.0.1/8	   |   255.0.0.0

     172.16.1.1	 |  /12 - Ex: 172.16.1.1/12 |  255.240.0.0
     
     192.168.0.1 |  /16 - Ex: 192.168.0.1/16 | 255.255.0.0
     
     192.168.0.1 |  /24 - Ex: 192.168.0.1/24 | 255.255.255.0
     
     
     -+ Some IP networks are reserved for only a certain kind of traffic. The IP addresses in the table above are reserved for only internal organizational use; meaning they should not be routed on the Internet. These kinds of IP addresses are commonly refferred to as RFC1918 addresses.
     
     
     DIFFERENT NETWORKS
     
"
    ~ Let us take a look at different networks within RFC1918 and how large the networks are:

    10.0.0.0/8 - More than 16 million IP addresses
    172.16.0.0/12 - About 1 million IP addresses
    192.168.0.0/16 - 65534 IP addresses

IP segments can be further broken up into smaller and more granular networks.

Each network has a reserved address for broadcasting traffic to every host in the network, this is called the broadcast address. Broadcasting data means sending data to everyone on the network instead of sending to just a single host. There are many applications and protocols which rely on broadcasting traffic in order for them to work.

For each network segment the broadcast is always last IP address in the network. For example in the network 192.168.0.0/24 network, the broadcast address is 192.168.0.255.

The smallest netmask possible is 255.255.255.255, represented as /32. This network only has one IP address.

If traffic needs to be sent back to the host, e.g. for communications between applications, it is sent to the localhost address. This address is always 127.0.0.1 and is a /8 network.

In IP networks the traffic is routed by a router. A router is a networking device which understands the IP format and can forward packets between networks. This is different than a switch as the switch forwards data within a network, while the router forwards between networks.		
"

" 
The Source Address is the IP address of the system who is sending the packet, and destination is to whom the packet is intended. There are also other fields in the header which is used by the many features of the IP protocol, but which are outside the scope of this introduction class.

You can check your IP address on Windows by running the command ipconfig within a Command Line Window. On Linux this is done with the ip addr show or ifconfig command.

When a computer needs to communicate to something which can not be found on the LAN, it sends traffic to the default gateway as per how the system is configured. The default gateway being a router which is capable of forwarding the traffic to the 	destination IP address. 			
"

  NAT ("Network Address Translation")
  
"
NAT allows a system accepting connections on a public IP address to map those requests to an internal RFC 1918 IP address or vice versa. Systems which do NAT'ing are typically firewalls and routers.

A typical implementation of NAT is where the external IP address is used as a front for multiple internal IP addresses, and the destination port number is used to decide which server the data should be sent to. This allows internal IP addresses to receive traffic from external systems.

Another very common implementation is allowing internal IP addresses to access the internet with an external IP address. The NAT keeps track of connections from internal to destination addresses and forwards traffic across the connections.

NAT can be configured in many ways, but in this class you we do not go into more details of the method.

"

  IPv6 - IP Version 6
  
  "
  
  IP version 6 is the latest standard for IP and was made to support more IP addresses. Instead of using 32 bits of addressing for IP addresses, 128 bits is used. This allows for enough IP addresses for the foreseeable future while IPv4 has already run out.

IPv6 addresses uses 8 groups of of 4 hexadecimal numbers. An IPv6 address look like this: 2a00:1450:400f:80a::200e:. Notice it does not have have the 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal numbers. This is because IPv6 addresses can be shortened via simple rules:

    Leading 0's can be shortened
    Double colon (::) can be used to represent a continuous string of 0's.

The expanded IPv6 address is: 2a00:1450:400f:080a:0000:0000:0000:200e.

The localhost can be reduced into ::1 and ::.

IPv6 has networks, i.e. subnets, just like IPv4 has.

"

"
Run ipconfig and see if you see any IPv6 addresses. If you have IPv6 enabled, try ping -6 google.com and ping -4 google.com. See how the command allows us to use either IPv4 or IPv6?
"

  	ICMP
  
  icmp is often associated with ping and traceroute. icmp can be used for other things such as as a node for its time referred to as an icmp timestamp request. an icmp timestamp request simply allows e.g. a router to ask another router to sychronize their time, an important attribute in network communications.
  
  a common tactic for attackers to check is if system are available on a network, is to conduct a Ping Sweep. the goal of the activity is to make the target device in a network range reply to ping requests so that the attacker knows it is available. this approach is naive as many systems by default block incoming pings.
  
  Traceroute
  
 "
 
 Tracerouting is a way to determine which routers are involved in sending a packet from system A to B. Knowing which routers our packets take can be useful both better understanding our networks and also in understanding the attack surface. A router is responsible for routing the package in the right direction. Imagine this as driving on a road, where road signs at intersections guide you to the destination. These signs at intersections  represent routers. Traceroute identify these signs and intersections and tells you how far away they are, measured in milliseconds (ms).

The IPv4 TTL and IPv6 Hop Limit headers have the same function. Every router who routes a packet will decrement this value by 1, and if the value reaches 0 the router will discard the packet and return an ICMP Time Exceeded packet to the sender.

To perform a traceroute on Windows:
tracert google.com

To perform a traceroute on Linux (not installed by default):
traceroute google.com

The process of tracerouting via these tools is simple:

    The operating system sends a packet google.com, the TTL value is set to 1.
    The packet is routed on the network, and the first router decrements the TTL by 1, leaving it at 0. This causes the router to drop the packet and send "ICMP Time Exceeded" back to the source.
    The client increases the TTL 1, allowing the packet to be routed through one additional hop.

This process is repeated, increasing the TTL with 1 until the destination has been reached.

"

 	DNS ("Domain Name System")
 	
"
 
DNS is used to map applications, via names, to IP addresses. For example if you want to use your browser to visit http://google.com, the browser must first make a request to a DNS server to resolve the IP address behind google.com

Systems are typically configured with a primary and secondary domain name server. These settings can be configured manually or be provided by a DHCP server. This allows our computer systems to reach a DNS server for it to resolve for us.

The DNS server is then responsible for resolving the request. It will then proceed to check its own cache to see if it already knows the answer. Each DNS answer can be cached, that is stored temporarily to speed up future requests, for a certain TTL ("Time To Live"). The TTL is typically set to a couple of minutes, for example 10 minutes.

If a DNS server does not have a answer in its cache it will then proceed to check who is responsible for giving the answer. This is done via a recursive process which involves asking a hierarchical system of name servers which inevitably will make the DNS request to end up at the Authoritative Name Server.

You can try to do a DNS lookup with Windows or Linux now. From a command line terminal on Windows type nslookup w3schools.com , or on Linux type dig w3schools.com. You should see output like this:

( 
Finding authoritative name server on Windows:
nslookup -type=SOA google.com

Finding authoritative name server on Linux:
dig -t SOA google.com
 )

"

  DHCP ("Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol")
  
"

As the name implies, the DHCP protocol allows any system on a network to reach out to a server and receive a configuration. Such configuration typically implies receiving IP address and network range, default gateway and DNS servers.

DHCP allows for easy management of clients joining and leaving a network.

If you are curious if you are using DHCP right now you can type ipconfig /all on a Windows system and look for "DHCP Enabled: Yes" in the output. Your computer might have multiple network interfaces

"

  VPN ("Virtual Private Network")
 
 "
  
 A VPN is a system which enables two system to establish encrypted forms for communication, enabling network traffic to be encrypted in transit. Many VPN's is a client to server architecture, allowing the client to access multiple services behind the VPN. VPN's hosted by your work place is also likely to provide access to resources otherwise only accessible from the inside.

Some VPN services are designed for user privacy and encryption for data in transit. These services enables users to send network data via the VPN, effectively masquerading the users IP address when navigating the Internet.

It is generally good practice to use VPN's to secure your network communications, however we should not use any kind of VPN service. Free VPN services can sometimes be malicious, inspecting, reading and storing your sensitive data.

--- Cyber Security Network Transport ---

"

In-Depth Transport and Link Layers

Computer systems often needs to talk to other systems; this is done by putting them on the same network. Several different technologies are in place to enable computers to talk over different kinds of networks. In this section we will go deeper into the protocols which are used in most networks.

The networks we are using consists of multiple protocols, some which are featured in this class. There are also many other protocols in use in networks, all which have the potential of having security risks associated with them.
TCP ("Transmission Control Protocol")

Just like IP uses IP addresses for addressing, TCP and UDP uses ports. A port, as indicated with a number between 0 and 65535, dictates which network service should process the request. 

In the picture below we can see a TCP packet and how it would look like for anyone inspecting traffic on the network.

We can see the graphic showing 16 bits for both source and destination ports, this is the same for for UDP. The Sequence and Acknowledgement numbers are used in the three-way handshake and to reliably transfer data. We can also see the control bits used to indicate what kind of packet it is. The other headers also play an important part, but outside of the security course.

"

TCP 3-Way-Handshake

TCP uses a three-way handshake to allow two systems to engage in communications. The handshake uses 32 bits of PRNG ("Pseudo Random Number Generator") numbers to establish the handshake. The handshake enforces that both parties intends to communicate.

Here is a graphic to illustrate:
'thin_tcp3way_handshake.png'


"

-- Spoofing Traffic --

There are few restrictions on networks to create packets as so. anyone can create packets with any of the fields of the headers set to whatever value they desire. This is called spoofing, allowing attackers to send traffic on behalf of others.

TCP has security built into the protocol, but it relies on the strength of the PRNG("Psuedo Random Number Generator") # generators. If the sequence numbers of communicating parties, can be guessed, the security of TCP can be compromised in the sense that an attacker can engage in spoofed communications via TCP.

Many protocols are easily spoofed , but TCP offers some resiliency againt this. Protocols such as UDP and ICMP do not offer similar protection.

"

Spoofing packets is typically done by attackers with root / system capabilities, i.e. the highest privileges on the Operating System. The reason being that Operating Systems enforces the use of API's which forces the user to conform to the rules of communications as specified in RFC's ("Request For Comments"). If the attacker does not have the highest privileges, they will not be able to craft their own packets on the network.

"

-- UDP ("User Datagram Protocol") ---

 UDP is used for traffic which does not need the resilience and security of TCP, typically applications such as VOIP, but in the modern world more applications are using UDP to support fast packet transfer with resiliency and security built into the higher levels of the OSI model; QUIC is an example of this.
 
 Looking at the UDP Header we can see the same Source and Destination ports in use, but no Sequence numbers or Control bits. The protocol has much less overhead, leading to faster transmission of data.
 
 -- ARP --
 
 "
 
 ARP ("Address Resolution Protocol") is the protocol which allows computer systems to know which MAC address belongs to which IP address. If the traffic has to be routed, the computer system will forward traffic to the Default Gateway configured on the system.

ARP, like DNS, is a protocol which resolves one address into another. Every time a system tries to communicate to an IP address which is on the LAN it will check its ARP cache to see if has recently been resolved.

You can inspect your own ARP. Simply run the command arp -a on both Linux or Windows. This reveals which systems your system has recently communicated with.

"

-- VLAN ("Virtual LAN") --

"

VLAN, often called Private VLAN's, is a way for a Switch to embed tags (or a VLAN ID) within the Frame. Multiple Switches can then make sure that computer systems on the LAN can only communicate to certain other systems, i.e. other systems on with the same VLAN ID.

"
